# Cricket Score Predictor

The **Cricket Score Predictor** is a Python-based machine learning program that uses historical match data to predict the final score of a cricket team. The program employs a **Random Forest Regressor** model to make predictions based on features such as cumulative runs, wickets lost, and current run rate.

## Features

- Predict the final score of a cricket team based on in-match statistics.
- Model evaluation using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** metrics.
- Outputs predictions in a CSV file for further analysis.

---

## Prerequisites

To run the program, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6+
- Required Python packages:
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `numpy`

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
```

---

## Data Requirements

The program expects a pre-processed CSV file named `processed_data.csv` with the following columns:

1. **cumulative_runs**: Runs scored so far.
2. **cumulative_wickets**: Wickets lost so far.
3. **current_run_rate**: Current run rate of the batting team.
4. **final_score**: The actual final score of the innings (used as the target variable).
5. Optional columns for additional context (e.g., team, opponent).

---

## How It Works

1. **Load the data**: The script reads the input CSV file (`processed_data.csv`) into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Feature extraction**: It uses `cumulative_runs`, `cumulative_wickets`, and `current_run_rate` as input features (`X`) and `final_score` as the target variable (`y`).
3. **Train-test split**: The data is split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).
4. **Model training**: A **Random Forest Regressor** is trained on the training data.
5. **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated on the test set using MSE and RMSE metrics.
6. **Prediction**: The model predicts the final scores for the test set, and the results are saved to a CSV file.

---

## Output

The script generates a file named `final_score_predictions.csv`, which contains:

- **Team**: Name of the batting team.
- **Opponent**: Name of the opposing team.
- **Actual Final Score**: The actual final score of the innings.
- **Predicted Final Score**: The model's predicted final score.

## Running the Script

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Place your processed dataset (`processed_data.csv`) in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python cricket_score_predictor.py
   ```

4. View the predictions in `final_score_predictions.csv`.

## Example Output

Sample `final_score_predictions.csv`:

| Team        | Opponent    | Actual Final Score | Predicted Final Score |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Team A      | Team B      | 250                | 245.3                |
| Team C      | Team D      | 180                | 185.7                |

## Model Performance

The program evaluates the model using the following metrics:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted scores.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of MSE, providing a measure in the same units as the target variable.

---

## Customization

You can customize the following aspects of the program:

1. **Input features**: Modify the features (`X`) based on your dataset.
2. **Model parameters**: Adjust the `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, or other parameters of the `RandomForestRegressor` for better performance.
3. **Dataset path**: Change the `file_path` variable to load data from a different location.
